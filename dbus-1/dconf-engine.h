/**
 * DConfEngineMessage:
 *
 * This structure represents a number of DBus method call messages that #DConfEngine would like to send.
 *
 * #DConfEngine itself is unaware of a particular DBus or main loop implementation.  As such, all requests are
 * synchronous and non-blocking, but most of them produce a #DConfEngineMessage describing messages that must be
 * sent in order for the operation to be completed.
 *
 * @bus_name, @object_path, @interface_name, @method_name specify the respective header fields of the method
 * call.  These are always equal for all of the calls contained within a single #DConfEngineMessage.
 *
 * @reply_type is the expected reply type of the method call.  This is also the same for all calls contained
 * within a single #DConfEngineMessage.
 *
 * @n_messages is the number of messages to send.
 *
 * @bus_types and @parameters are both arrays, of length @n_messages.  Each element of @bus_type is the bus type
 * to send each method call on and each of @parameters is the body of that call.  The reason that there may be
 * several messages is that a single dconf "watch" operation may need to send multiple DBus "AddMatch" calls
 * (and usually to multiple busses).
 *
 * Each element in @bus_types is either 'y' for system bus or 'e' for session bus.
 *
 * A #DConfEngineMessage is always stack-allocated by the caller.  It must be cleared using
 * dconf_engine_message_destroy() when done.  It may be copied using dconf_engine_message_copy().

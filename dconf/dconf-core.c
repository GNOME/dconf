 * result in waking up every process watching for any change

 *
 * In the event of a failure of any kind then no changes will be made to
 * the database, %error (if non-%NULL) will be set and %FALSE will be
 * returned.
 *
 * If the merge is successful then %TRUE will be returned.  If @event_id
 * is non-%NULL it will be set to the event ID number of the merge.  The

 * @title: DConfClient
 * @short_description: Direct read and write access to dconf, based on GDBus
 *
 * This is the primary client interface to dconf.
 *
 * It allows applications to directly read from and write to the dconf
 * database.  Applications can subscribe to change notifications.
 *
 * Most applications probably don't want to access dconf directly and
 * would be better off using something like #GSettings.
 *
 * Please note that the API of libdconf is not stable in any way.  It
 * has changed in incompatible ways in the past and there will be
 * further changes in the future.

   *
   * To ensure that you receive notification about changes to paths that
   * you are interested in you must call dconf_client_watch_fast() or
   * dconf_client_watch_sync().  You may still receive notifications for
   * paths that you did not explicitly watch.
   *
   * @prefix will be an absolute dconf path; see dconf_is_path().
   * @changes is a %NULL-terminated array of dconf rel paths; see
   * dconf_is_rel_path().
   *
   * @tag is an opaque tag string, or %NULL.  The only thing you should
   * do with @tag is to compare it to tag values returned by
   * dconf_client_write_sync() or dconf_client_change_sync().
   *
   * The number of changes being reported is equal to the length of
   * @changes.  Appending each item in @changes to @prefix will give the
   * absolute path of each changed item.
   *
   * If a single key has changed then @prefix will be equal to the key
   * and @changes will contain a single item: the empty string.
   *
   * If a single dir has changed (indicating that any key under the dir
   * may have changed) then @prefix will be equal to the dir and
   * @changes will contain a single empty string.
   *
   * If more than one change is being reported then @changes will have

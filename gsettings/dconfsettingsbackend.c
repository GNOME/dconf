 *
 *  1) directly connected to the engine
 *
 *    In this case the 'changeset' and 'parent' fields are NULL.
 *
 *  2) acting as a delayed backend
 *
 *    In this case the 'changeset' field is non-NULL and the 'parent'
 *    field points at the DConfSettingsBackend that is parent to this
 *    backend.  This is a strong reference.
 *
 * In either case the 'children' list contains the list of delayed
 * settings objects that have this object as their parent.  These are
 * weak references (since the strong reference is in the child->parent
 * direction).  We use GWeakRef here to make sure we don't try to send
 * signals to an object that's already half-disposed in another thread.
 *
 * We use code locking.
 *
 * The average GSettings-using program will only ever have a single
 * backend.  Even those that use the "delayed" functionality will only
 * have one or two and, even in that case, most interactions will
 * require locking of multiple backends anyway.  The logic is much
 * easier if there is only a single lock.
 *
 * An interesting possibility might be to share a lock per-engine (or
 * use the engine's lock itself).

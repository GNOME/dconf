/**
 * This module contains the production implementations of methods used in
 * dconf_shm that need to be mocked out for tests.
 *
 * In some cases, external methods are wrapped with a different name. This is
 * done so that it is not necessary to redefine the external functions in
 * unit tests in order to mock them out, and therefore easy to also call the
 * non mocked versions in tests if necessary.

/**
 * dconf_writer_merge_index:
 * @writer: a #DConfWriter
 * @index: in/out parameter for the index of the directory
 * @prefix: the prefix (as per the dconf_merge() call)
 * @names: the array of relative names (as per the dconf_merge() call)
 * @values: the array of values (as per the dconf_merge() call)
 * @n_items: the size of @names and @values
 * @must_copy: %TRUE if we should not attempt an in-place update
 * @returns: %TRUE on success or %FALSE if we ran out of space
 *
 * Execute an update of the database by merging one or more new values
 * into a (possibly) existing directory entry in one atomic operation.
 *
 * This is the function that does all the work in dconf.  It is very
 * complicated and this entire file is dedicated to implementing it.
 *
 * It is equivalent to performing the following set operations:
 *
 *   for (i = 0; i < n_items; i++)
 *     set (prefix + names[i], values[i]);
 *
 * such that all changes appear simultaneously.
 *
 * In the event that it is not possible to perform such a change
 * atomically then a new directory entry is allocated, the directory is
 * copied and modified and @index is updated to reflect the new
 * directory location.  The value of @index is not updated at any
 * particular time, so it must not point to the mapped file.
 *
 * If @must_copy is %TRUE then this algorithm makes no attempt to do an
 * in-place update and always copies anything that it modifies.  This is
 * required in the case of a simple update to a leaf when other updates
 * are occuring in other places of the tree so that these updates can
 * appear simultaneously.
 *
 * In the event of a failure to allocate space in the mapped file (which
 * is the only non-abort()ing way that this operation can fail) %FALSE
 * is returned.  Try again with a larger file.
 *
 * The @names array must be sorted in strcmp() order.
 *
 * @prefix must be relative to the directory at @index (ie: not start
 * with '/').  @prefix is also permitted to be the empty string.
 *
 * @n_items may not be zero.  If @n_items is 1 and the single element in
 * @names is the empty string then @prefix must be non-empty and must
 * end in a character that is not '/'.  This is the case of setting a
 * single key whose name is given entirely in @prefix.
 *
 * If @n_items is 2 or more (or if the single element in @names is not
 * the empty string) then @prefix must either be the empty string or end
 * in '/'.  Each item in @names is relative to that path.

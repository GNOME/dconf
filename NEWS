Changes in dconf 0.7.2
======================

This is entirely a cleanup/fixes release.  Some fixes here to make the
increasingly-strict toolchain happy, and also some fixes for some
crashers in the GSettings backend and service.

 - remove some unused variables (new GCC gives a warning: #640566, another)
 - add a mutex to fix multi-threading issue (#640611)
 - don't crash if we have no D-Bus
 - clean up symbol exports
 - fix a crash in the service when using 'reset'
 - drop old linker options that were for libtool

Changes in dconf 0.7.1
======================

The last release contained a few problems that caused build failures on
some strict linkers.  Those should be fixed now.

Changes in dconf 0.7
====================

 - new library to use dconf with libdbus-1
 - quite a lot of improvements and bug-fixes in dconf-editor, thanks to
   Robert Ancell
 - some bug fixes in the GSettings backend (crashers caused by use if
   custom dconf profiles)
 - some FreeBSD build fixes
 - increased Vala dependency to 0.11.4 (required for dconf-editor fixes)

Changes in dconf 0.6
====================

 - Rewrite a lot of the GSettings backend to reduce GDBus abuse.  We use
   our own worker thread now instead of trying to hijack GDBus's.
 - disable gobject-introspection support for now
 - drop support for GTK2 in dconf-editor
 - Add a new torture-test case
 - Increase dbus timeout to 2 minutes (in case the service is heavily loaded)
 - Fix several memory leaks and other bugs

Changes in dconf 0.5.1
======================

 - Adjust to GDBus API changes
 - Send correct object path in Notify on WriteMany
 - Use printf() and exit() instead of g_error() to avoid too many crash
   reports for now
 - Require gobject-introspection 0.9.5
 - Require vala 0.9.5
 - Make dconf-editor optional
 - Drop libgee requirement for dconf-editor
 - Tweak shared library installation to make ldconfig happy
 - Bump .gir version to dconf-1.0
 - Fix introspection build with recent gobject-introspection
 - Minor bug fixes

Changes in dconf 0.5
=====================

 - Include a dconf-editor
 - drop libtool
 - allow compiling without gobject-introspection
 - autotools/build fixups
 - repair some broken use of tags
 - many updates for glib API changes
 - fix a crasher in the service
 - prefer 'automake-1.11' if it is in the path
 - add support for layering (ie: for system defaults)
 - add support for multiple writers in one service
 - add a shared memory status region to indicate if the gvdb is stale
     this prevents dconf from having to reopen the file each time
 - support keyfile-maintained system settings (via 'dconf update')
 - port client library and commandline tool to vala
 - client library no longer has unimplemented calls
   (except for write_many_async, due to bugs in valac)
 - gtk-doc is now complete for the client library
 - install our own vapi
 - support 'reset' in the GSettingsBackend

Changes in dconf 0.4
=====================

 - fix crashes when the dconf database doesn't yet exist
 - add some incomplete gtk-doc
 - use new GVDB (note: dconf file format has incompatibly changed)
 - implement GSettings sync()
 - use string tags instead of sequence numbers since it was impossible
   to have universally unique sequence numbers
 - theoretical support for sharing dconf databases between machines with
   different byte orders
 - fix bug where first write was not successful when auto-starting
   service
 - FreeBSD build fixes
 - client API cleanups
 - GObject introspection support
 - enable automake silent rules by default for tarball builds

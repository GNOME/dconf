Changes in dconf 0.4
=====================

 - fix crashes when the dconf database doesn't yet exist
 - add some incomplete gtk-doc
 - use new GVDB (note: dconf file format has incompatibly changed)
 - implement GSettings sync()
 - use string tags instead of sequence numbers since it was impossible
   to have universally unique sequence numbers
 - theoretical support for sharing dconf databases between machines with
   different byte orders
 - fix bug where first write was not successful when auto-starting
   service
 - FreeBSD build fixes
 - client API cleanups

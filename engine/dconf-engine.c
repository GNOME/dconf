/* The engine has zero or more sources.
 *
 * If it has zero sources then things are very uninteresting.  Nothing
 * is writable, nothing will ever be written and reads will always
 * return NULL.
 *
 * There are two interesting cases when there is a non-zero number of
 * sources.  Writing only ever occurs to the first source, if at all.
 * Non-first sources are never writable.
 *
 * The first source may or may not be writable.  In the usual case the
 * first source is the one in the user's home directory and is writable,
 * but it may be that the profile was setup for read-only access to
 * system sources only.
 *
 * In the case that the first source is not writable (and therefore
 * there are no writable sources), is_writable() will always return
 * FALSE and no writes will ever be performed.
 *
 * It's possible to request changes in three ways:
 *
 *  - synchronous: the D-Bus message is immediately sent to the
 *    dconf service and we block until we receive the reply.  The change
 *    signal will follow soon thereafter (when we receive the signal on
 *    D-Bus).
 *
 *  - asynchronous: typical asynchronous operation: we send the request
 *    and return immediately, notifying using a callback when the
 *    request is completed (and the new value is in the database).  The
 *    change signal follows in the same way as with synchronous.
 *
 *  - fast: we record the value locally and signal the change, returning
 *    immediately, as if the value is already in the database (from the
 *    viewpoint of the local process).  We keep note of the new value
 *    locally until the service has confirmed that the write was
 *    successful.  If the write fails, we emit a change signal.  From
 *    the view of the program it looks like the value was successfully
 *    changed but then quickly changed back again by some external
 *    agent.
 *
 * In fast mode we have to do some management of the queue.  If we
 * immediately put all requests "in flight" then we can end up in a
 * situation where the application writes many values for the same key
 * and the service is kept (needlessly) busy writing over and over to
 * the same key for some time after the requests stop coming in.
 *
 * If we limit the number of in-flight requests and put the other ones
 * into a pending queue then we can perform merging of similar changes.
 * If we notice that an item in the pending queue writes to the same
 * keys as the newly-added request then we can simply drop the existing
 * request (since its effect will be nullified by the new request).
 *
 * We want to keep the number of in-flight requests low in order to
 * maximise our chance of dropping pending items, but we probably want
 * it higher than 1 so that we can pipeline to hide latency.
 *
 * In order to minimise complexity, all changes go first to the pending
 * queue.  Changes are dispatched from the pending queue (and moved to
 * the in-flight queue) when the number of requests in-flight is lower
 * than the maximum.
 *
 * For both 'in_flight' and 'pending' queues we push to the tail and pop
 * from the head.  This puts the first operation on the head and the
 * most recent operation on the tail.
 *
 * Since new operation go first to the pending queue, we find the most
 * recent operations at the tail of that queue.  Since we want to return
 * the most-recently written value, we therefore scan for values
 * starting at the tail of the pending queue and ending at the head of
 * the in-flight queue.
 *
 * NB: I tell a lie.  Async is not supported yet.
 *
 * Notes about threading:
 *
 * The engine is oblivious to threads and main contexts.
 *
 * What this means is that the engine has no interaction with GMainLoop
 * and will not schedule idles or anything of the sort.  All calls made
 * by the engine to the client library will be made in response to
 * incoming method calls, from the same thread as the incoming call.
 *
 * If dconf_engine_call_handle_reply() or
 * dconf_engine_handle_dbus_signal() are called from 'exotic' threads
 * (as will often be the case) then the resulting calls to
 * dconf_engine_change_notify() will come from the same thread.  That's
 * left for the client library to deal with.
 *
 * All that said, the engine is completely threadsafe.  The client
 * library can call any method from any thread at any time -- as long as
 * it is willing to deal with receiving the change notifies in those
 * threads.
 *
 * Thread-safety is implemented using two locks.
 *
 * The first lock (sources_lock) protects the sources.  Although the
 * sources are only ever read from, it is necessary to lock them because
 * it is not safe to read during a refresh (when the source is being
 * closed and reopened).  Accordingly, sources_lock need only be
 * acquired when accessing the parts of the sources that are subject to
 * change as a result of refreshes; the static parts (like bus type,
 * object path, etc) can be accessed without holding the lock.  The
 * 'sources' array itself (and 'n_sources') are set at construction and
 * never change after that.
 *
 * The second lock (queue_lock) protects the various queues that are
 * used to implement the "fast" writes described above.
 *
 * If both locks are held at the same time then the sources lock must
 * have been acquired first.

 *
 * We could probably optimise this to avoid checking some databases in
 * certain cases (ie: we do not need to check the user's database when
 * we are only interested in checking writability) but this works well
 * enough for now and is less prone to errors.
 *
 * We could probably change to a reader/writer situation that is only
 * holding the write lock when actually making changes during a refresh
 * but the engine is probably only ever really in use by two threads at
 * a given time (main thread doing reads, DBus worker thread clearing
 * the queue) so it seems unlikely that lock contention will become an
 * issue.
 *
 * If it does, we can revisit this...

  /* There are a number of situations that this function has to deal

   *
   * With respect to the steady-state condition with no locks:
   *
   *   This is the case where there are no changes queued, no
   *   read_through and no locks.
   *
   *   The value returned is the one from the lowest-index source that
   *   contains that value.
   *
   * With respect to locks:
   *
   *   If a lock is present (except in source #0 where it is ignored)
   *   then we will only return a value found in the source where the
   *   lock was present, or a higher-index source (following the normal
   *   rule that sources with lower indexes take priority).
   *
   *   This statement includes read_through and queued changes.  If a
   *   lock is found, we will ignore those.
   *
   * With respect to read_through and queued changed:
   *
   *   We only consider read_through and queued changes in the event
   *   that we have a writable source.  This will possibly cause us to
   *   ignore read_through and will have no real effect on the queues
   *   (since they will be empty anyway if we have no writable source).
   *
   *   We only consider read_through and queued changes in the event
   *   that we have not found any locks.
   *
   *   If there is a non-NULL value found in read_through or the queued
   *   changes then we will return that value.
   *
   *   If there is a NULL value (ie: a reset) found in read_through or
   *   the queued changes then we will only ignore any value found in
   *   the first source (which must be writable, or else we would not
   *   have been considering read_through and the queues).  This is
   *   consistent with the fact that a reset will unset any value found
   *   in this source but will not affect values found in lower sources.
   *
   *   Put another way: if a non-writable source contains a value for a
   *   particular key then it is impossible for this function to return
   *   NULL.
   *
   * We implement the above rules as follows.  We have three state
   * tracking variables:
   *
   *   - lock_level: records if and where we found a lock
   *
   *   - found_key: records if we found the key in any queue
   *
   *   - value: records the value of the found key (NULL for resets)
   *
   * We take these steps:
   *
   *  1. check for lockdown.  If we find a lock then we prevent any
   *     other sources (including read_through and pending/in-flight)
   *     from affecting the value of the key.
   *
   *     We record the result of this in the lock_level variable.  Zero
   *     means that no locks were found.  Non-zero means that a lock was
   *     found in the source with the index given by the variable.
   *
   *  2. check the uncommitted changes in the read_through list as the
   *     highest priority.  This is only done if we have a writable
   *     source and no locks were found.
   *
   *     If we found an entry in the read_through then we set
   *     'found_key' to TRUE and set 'value' to the value that we found
   *     (which will be NULL in the case of finding a reset request).
   *
   *  3. check our pending and in-flight "fast" changes (in that order).
   *     This is only done if we have a writable source and no locks
   *     were found.  It is also only done if we did not find the key in
   *     the read_through.
   *
   *  4. check the first source, if there is one.
   *
   *     This is only done if 'found_key' is FALSE.  If 'found_key' is
   *     TRUE then it means that the first database was writable and we
   *     either found a value that will replace it (value != NULL) or
   *     found a pending reset (value == NULL) that will unset it.
   *
   *     We only actually do this step if we have a writable first
   *     source and no locks found, otherwise we just let step 5 do all
   *     the checking.
   *
   *  5. check the remaining sources.
   *
   *     We do this until we have value != NULL.  Even if found_key was
   *     TRUE, the reset that was requested will not have affected the
   *     lower-level databases.
